# This website is made using React.js. 
#### This was a part of my lessons in school to learn React.
The website is for searching games in a list inside of src/data/games.js.

How to use:
* First decide the type of console
    (You can search on just the console)
* type the title of one of the games in the list (part of the title works too)
    List of games here:  [src/data/games.js](https://github.com/TiesHogenboom/Backlog/blob/main/src/data/games.js).
